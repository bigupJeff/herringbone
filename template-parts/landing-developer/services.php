                        As a web designer, I deal with the research and idea stages of
                        a development project. Working with you through a structured
                        process to combine research data, branding and project goals to produce
                        visual designs of the final product. Every aspect of the busines goals
						and target-users needs are considered to successfully inform the designs.

                        As a web developer, I code the website designs and backend

                        site traffic, security and performance. The front end is built and
                        styled with a continuous develop and test cycle to ensure the interface
                        is on-spec with the intended experience.

                        WordPress is the worlds number one website platform which as of August 2024
                        powers 43.5%

                        </sup>
                        of all websites! It&apos;s a versatile and user-friendly platform that was
                        originally built for blogging but now powers everything from e-commerce to
                        social media platforms. The real power of WordPress is in its infinite
                        potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With WordPress I can quickly launch a website with the aid of existing
                        themes and plugins. If you have big ideas but a tight budget, we can achieve
                        great results by off-setting development time with these existing building
                        blocks. For large projects, your requirements are the limit as I can code
						any bespoke theme, plugin or feature from scratch.

                        providing advice on digital next steps to grow your business.

                    <p>
                        Whether building from scratch, or improving the performance of an existing
                        site, search engine optimisation (SEO) is a vital consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By comparing your goals with the market landscape and the measured SEO
                        performance of any existing sites, I compile an SEO plan to push your
                        website under the noses of search engine users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From here I can either provide a report for your consideration, or perform
                        all changes on your behalf. This will likely involve improvements to your
                        website template markup (code), your content both written and visual and
                        other domain-affecting assets e.g. email campaigns.

                    <p>
                        As a digital marketer, I leverage web-based channels and search engine
                        optimisation to help spread a message. Starting from the ground up,
                        web pages are coded with semantically logical structure, meaningful
                        linking and adoption of the Open Graph protocol for rich social media
                        integration. I perform AND implement full technical SEO audits on
                        existing sites. Paid advertising is used across Google, Bing, and
                        social platforms to maximise outreach while organic content gains
                        traction.
